# Translation sniffer

## The idea

When reading texts in foreign language I often find myself searching for the transactions of the same words on and on.
I'd like to have a solution which will monitor my usage of dictionaries (e.g. via browser extension) and memorize what I was looking for.
Later on I can get back to those words and learn them.

New words should be found easily, e.g. by opening a new empty tab.
